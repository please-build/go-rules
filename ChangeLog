Version 1.11.1
--------------
    * Fix issue with the go package driver for packages from `go_repo()` targets

Version 1.11.0
--------------
    * Add `ValidateModuleVersion` plugin option, which ensures that module
      paths and versions given to `go_mod_download` comply with Go's module
      version numbering policy (#171). This option is disabled by default,
      but will become enabled by default in a future major version of the
      plugin.

-------------
    * Honour `flags` argument correctly to `go_test`

Version 1.7.5
-------------
    * Fix issue with missing test results when tests call `os.Exit()` when using go 1.20+. This only
      caused the report to miss rows, as the test result file wasn't being flushed, but would never
      cause the test to pass when it should have failed. (#142)

Version 1.7.4
-------------
    * Fix issues with with tests using TestMain in go1.20+ where we would run the tests
      for them. This is the responsibility of TestMain.
    * Set GOROOT when compiling stdlib as we need this for setting `pkg/include` for cgo/asm (#138)

Version 1.7.3
-------------
    * Refactor `please_go` download test to avoid subrepo references (#136)

------------
    * Use correct version of the go tool (#128)
    * Write `asm.h` to the tmp dir rather than the goroot (#125)

Version 1.7.0
------------
    * Add `ModFile` config option which when set will resolve all `go_repo()` targets against the
      modules in this file. This doesn't do a huge amount but will avoid situations where you had
      to previously pass in modules through the `requirements` arg to `go_repo()` (#118)
    * Pass in the generated `go_asm.h` file when compiling asm sources with `go_library()` (#116)

Version 1.6.0
------------
    * Rename `go_get` to `go_repo` and make it generally available (#102)

Version 1.5.0
-------------
    * Added support for compiling the Go stdlib in-repo independent of `go_toolchain`, via
      `stdlib` config argument and `go_stdlib` rule (#93).
    * Added support for Go build modes (which require the use of `go_stdlib` to compile correctly) (#93)

Version 1.4.1
-------------
    * Fix issue with missing stderr on test output when not using the new coverage redesign feature flag

Version 1.4.0
-------------
    * Improve support for case sensitive module names (#86)

-------------
    * Support for Go 1.20's coverage redesign (#84)
    * Added `go_system_toolchain` for adding a build of a toolchain off the local system

Version 1.1.3
-------------

    * Fix some issues with package info generation when go sources are in a subdirectory

Version 1.1.1
-------------
    * Use sha256 only for hashes

Version 1.1.0
-------------
    * Add `go_get()`, a subrepo based approach to third party code #49
    * Add a package driver to the releases. This can be used to help tools
      integrate with Please projects. This can be set via GOPACKAGESDRIVER
      env var and is used by a number of tools in the wild, include gopls
      and various linters.
