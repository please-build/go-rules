Version 1.7.6
-------------
    * Honour `flags` argument correctly to `go_test`

Version 1.7.5
-------------
    * Fix issue with missing test results when tests call `os.Exit()` when using go 1.20+. This only
      caused the report to miss rows, as the test result file wasn't being flushed, but would never
      cause the test to pass when it should have failed. (#142)

Version 1.7.4
-------------
    * Fix issues with with tests using TestMain in go1.20+ where we would run the tests
      for them. This is the responsibility of TestMain.
    * Set GOROOT when compiling stdlib as we need this for setting `pkg/include` for cgo/asm (#138)

Version 1.7.3
-------------
    * Refactor `please_go` download test to avoid subrepo references (#136)
      This fixes fatal errors with `plz query graph` in repos that use go-rules, a regression
      present since version 1.7.0.

Version 1.7.2
------------
    * Use correct version of the go tool (#128)
    * Write `asm.h` to the tmp dir rather than the goroot (#125)

------------
    * Added missing `resources` option to `go_benchmark` (#121)
    * Make modinfo require go (#123)

Version 1.7.0
------------
    * Add `ModFile` config option which when set will resolve all `go_repo()` targets against the
      modules in this file. This doesn't do a huge amount but will avoid situations where you had
      to previously pass in modules through the `requirements` arg to `go_repo()` (#118)
    * Pass in the generated `go_asm.h` file when compiling asm sources with `go_library()` (#116)

Version 1.6.0
------------
    * Rename `go_get` to `go_repo` and make it generally available (#102)

Version 1.5.0
-------------
    * Added support for compiling the Go stdlib in-repo independent of `go_toolchain`, via
      `stdlib` config argument and `go_stdlib` rule (#93).
    * Added support for Go build modes (which require the use of `go_stdlib` to compile correctly) (#93)

Version 1.4.1
-------------
    * Fix issue with missing stderr on test output when not using the new coverage redesign feature flag

Version 1.4.0
-------------
    * Improve support for case sensitive module names (#86)
    * Handle large source directories by passing srcs as file (#90)
    * Add an install argument to the beta `go_get()` rules to make them work more like `go_module()` (#87)

Version 1.3.0
-------------
    * Support for Go 1.20's coverage redesign (#84)
    * Added `go_system_toolchain` for adding a build of a toolchain off the local system
      (useful for 1.20 on a system where one cannot be downloaded, notably Alpine Linux) (#85)

Version 1.2.1
-------------
    * Go package info now gets written for the main package of a go_binary

Version 1.2.0
-------------
    * Support for Go 1.20 (#75)

Version 1.1.4

    * Don't generate Go package info targets when not generating import config

Version 1.1.3
-------------
    * Remove hashes test as the arch subrepo labels break things

Version 1.1.2
-------------
    * Fix some issues with package info generation when go sources are in a subdirectory

Version 1.1.1
-------------
    * Use sha256 only for hashes

Version 1.1.0
-------------
    * Add `go_get()`, a subrepo based approach to third party code #49
    * Add a package driver to the releases. This can be used to help tools
      integrate with Please projects. This can be set via GOPACKAGESDRIVER
      env var and is used by a number of tools in the wild, include gopls
      and various linters.
    * Backport a fix to the cgo code generation to include compiler flags,
      and package configuration #64

Version 1.0.0
-------------
    * Separate the CGO rules and use the C plugin instead of built in
      rules #27

Version 0.5.1

    * Fix the CGO config options in the go_toolchain() rule #44

Version 0.5.0
-------------
    * Add `env` to `go_test`, allowing specifying extra env vars.

Version 0.4.4
-------------
    * Remove additional 'test' labels on libraries.

Version 0.4.3
-------------

Version 0.3.0
-------------
    * Add config option to allow legacy imports #18
