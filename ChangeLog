      change for the vast majority of users - the only case in which a change is needed to the value
      of `cgo_enabled` after upgrading to v1.20.0 is if it is set to an esoteric value that Please
      does not already interpret as a boolean in a plugin configuration (i.e. something other than
      `1`, `0`, `true`, `false`, `on`, or `off`).

-------------
    * Honour `flags` argument correctly to `go_test`

Version 1.7.5
-------------
    * Fix issue with missing test results when tests call `os.Exit()` when using go 1.20+. This only
      caused the report to miss rows, as the test result file wasn't being flushed, but would never
      cause the test to pass when it should have failed. (#142)

Version 1.7.4
-------------
    * Fix issues with with tests using TestMain in go1.20+ where we would run the tests

------------

      modules in this file. This doesn't do a huge amount but will avoid situations where you had
      to previously pass in modules through the `requirements` arg to `go_repo()` (#118)
    * Pass in the generated `go_asm.h` file when compiling asm sources with `go_library()` (#116)
